            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Kevin Choi, a recent Flatiron School graduate and an enthusiastic software developer. With a solid foundation in full-stack development, I specialize in Python, Flask, JavaScript, React, and SQLAlchemy.

                One of my notable projects is SafeBites, an application designed to assist individuals with food allergies in finding safe dining options and recipes. This project showcases my skills in integrating APIs like Spoonacular and Yelp Fusion, building user-centric interfaces, and developing secure backend systems.
                
                Outside of coding, I lead an active lifestyle with a passion for gym workouts, pilates, boxing, kayaking with my dog, hiking, and cycling. Cooking and gaming are my favorite ways to relax and unwind.
                
                I’m currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills in a dynamic work environment where I can contribute to innovative projects, collaborate with a talented team, and continue to grow as a developer.</p>
